<h1>David's Interests and Yeah...</h1>
<p><h3>I lived in a city that is called Gardena. For a while a resided in California until me and my mom moved to Louisiana to seek a new life with Tony. As time moved on, things changed for the worst nad now it's just me and my mom...again. Although very sub-optimal our situation was, we are now perservering and striving to do each our best now.</p>

  <p>I'm genuinely interested in web design because it's really fun to make your own website. And also I would have something to do on my free time at home even though I don't really do it that often. Computer Science in general became more interesting when I looked into colleges that had such course and made me want to pursue that goal. Ever since I always kept myself updated with a game I very much adore, the more I realized how important the overall code was to the game, as without programming and coding the game, the assets, and environment would be very much less foundational. Simply put into a nuttshell, because og video games and how they worked, I became more interested how the game is actually made, despite how daunting and challenging the course is. But that's how you get good at it and along with other careers, requires failure in order to succeed. </p>

  <ul>
    <li>I'm very nervous around people especially women in general, but as the days pass by, I'm getting a little better.</li>
  
    <li>I really like hanging out with my friends despite being socially distant from others.</li>
    <li>Now, I'm trying to improve mentally and physically by doing my schoolwork on time and trying out other hobbies besides Video Games.</li>
